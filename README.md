## Introduction
---

before we dive in to this topic, I wanted to provide some context as to why I am doing this in the first place 


**TL;DR**: I am working on a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) application for `Red Teams` and other `offensive security geared organizations` or even just `enthusiasts` such as myself 


you can learn more about the `Red Teaming PaaS` platform [CryptCloud](https://github.com/OTRLabs/CryptCloud-Platform) by [OTR Labs](https://github.com/OTRLabs) 
just visit their [website](https://otrlabs.com/) or Github [repository](https://github.com/OTRLabs/CryptCloud-Platform)!


**Problem**

So, kinda funy, kinda embarrassing. 
I realized i donâ€™t really have enough experience with using existing [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) software to be designing my own.
Not that I am not allowed to just go and design my own [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service). 
but it's just kind of like... why not just use what exists?

Well, I have a few **reasons**. 

**Reasons**:
Appeal of designing my own [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) system:
- the obvious learning element
- focused on `offensive security`. (primarily with the database & `ML features`)
- obtain a higher level of `privacy`  
- pick my own service providers (that is a whole thing...)
    - mainly having to do with 3rd party integrations like oAuth, and Redis being pervasive 


*anyway* I want to make this list of things that I want to `improve on` in my own [PaaS service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) longer and more comprehensive.


This ensures that I am not wasting time developing my own [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) system, and am bringing something new to the table.




## 2. Plan

> So the plan...

The plan is to gain some experience developing on existing `open source` `PaaS platforms` by implementing `prototype versions` of `features` that I plan to implement in the [CryptCloud Platform](https://github.com/OTRLabs/CryptCloud-Platform) using these existing`PaaS platforms`
