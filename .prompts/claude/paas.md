## Introduction

### Background

Before diving into the technical aspects of this project, it's crucial to understand the context and motivation behind "Offensive PaaS". This research initiative is part of a broader effort to develop a [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) application tailored for Red Teams, offensive security organizations, and security enthusiasts.

The primary focus of this larger project is [CryptCloud](https://github.com/OTRLabs/CryptCloud-Platform), a Red Teaming PaaS platform developed by [OTR Labs](https://github.com/OTRLabs). For more information about CryptCloud, visit the [OTR Labs website](https://otrlabs.com/) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OTRLabs/CryptCloud-Platform).

### Problem Statement

During the development of CryptCloud, a realization emerged: there was a lack of hands-on experience with existing PaaS software. This gap in knowledge raised questions about the necessity of designing a new PaaS system from scratch versus leveraging existing solutions.

### Motivation

While the appeal of creating a custom PaaS system is strong, it's essential to justify this decision. The primary motivations for developing a new PaaS system include:

1. **Learning Opportunity**: Gaining in-depth knowledge of PaaS architecture and implementation.
2. **Offensive Security Focus**: Tailoring the system specifically for red teaming and offensive security operations, particularly in database and ML features.
3. **Enhanced Privacy**: Implementing stronger privacy controls than typically found in general-purpose PaaS offerings.
4. **Customized Service Integration**: Carefully selecting and integrating third-party services, with a focus on:
   - OAuth providers
   - Alternatives to commonly used services like Redis

To ensure that developing a custom PaaS system is not redundant, this project aims to:

- Explore existing open-source PaaS platforms
- Identify areas for improvement and innovation
- Develop proof-of-concept features that demonstrate the unique value proposition of CryptCloud

## Plan

### Objectives

The primary objectives of the Offensive PaaS project are:

1. Gain practical experience with existing open-source PaaS platforms
2. Implement prototype versions of features planned for the CryptCloud Platform
3. Identify limitations and potential security implications of current PaaS offerings
4. Develop a comprehensive list of improvements and innovations for CryptCloud

### Methodology

The project will follow these steps:

1. **Research**: Thoroughly investigate existing open-source PaaS platforms, focusing on their architecture, features, and security models.

2. **Feature Mapping**: Identify key features planned for CryptCloud and map them to equivalent functionalities in existing PaaS systems.

3. **Proof-of-Concept Development**: Create prototype implementations of CryptCloud features using selected open-source PaaS platforms.

4. **Security Analysis**: Assess the security implications of implementing offensive security tools on general-purpose PaaS systems.

5. **Documentation**: Thoroughly document findings, including limitations, potential risks, and areas for improvement.

6. **Iteration**: Use insights gained from this process to refine the CryptCloud Platform design and feature set.

### Target Platforms

The project will focus on the following open-source PaaS systems:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com): An open-source Firebase alternative
- [Pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase): A open-source backend for your next SaaS and Mobile app
- [Encore](https://encore.dev): A backend development engine

Each platform will be evaluated for its suitability in implementing offensive security features, with a particular emphasis on database operations and machine learning capabilities.
